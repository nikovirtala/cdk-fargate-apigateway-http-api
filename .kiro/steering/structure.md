## Source Code Organization

- `src/main.ts` - Main CDK application entry point containing the `HonkStack` class
  - Single stack architecture
  - All infrastructure defined in one file
  - Stack creates VPC, Fargate service, API Gateway, and supporting resources

## Docker Image

- `image/Dockerfile` - Container definition for the Fargate service
  - Serves the "Honk!" HTML page on port 8080

## Configuration Files

- `.projenrc.ts` - Projen project configuration (source of truth)
- `cdk.json` - CDK CLI configuration (generated by Projen)
- `package.json` - NPM dependencies and scripts (generated by Projen)
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration (generated by Projen)

## Conventions

- Infrastructure code is TypeScript-based using AWS CDK L2 constructs
- Single stack deployment model
- Resource naming follows pattern: `Honk<ResourceType>`
- VPC uses isolated subnets (no NAT Gateway) with VPC endpoints for AWS service access
- Fargate service uses FARGATE_SPOT as primary capacity provider for cost optimization
